      "text_Content": "Despite the many complex components, the PS2(TM) is still very powerful hardware. High-end hardware is required for good performance.Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 compatible devices are recommended. They have four large cores (Cortex-A75). When there are only two large cores (like on Snapdragon 700-series SoCs), performance is poor. Mali or PowerVR GPUs will work with the app,but performance will be significantly slower than Adreno GPUs and the Vulkan renderer is not supported. The dual-source blending function is also missing (an important feature).You can try the app if you have a slow device, but heavy tracks will play slowly. Negative cycle rate and positive cycle jump can be set in the system settings to slow down the processor, but this results in the game being intrinsically delayed at best and crashing at worst.",

It is currently in the early stages of development and is completely free. On GitHub, its creator has published technical details about this emulator, which you can see in the video above, Gran Turismo 4 runs great.One of the most important things to remember is that the emulator requires a BIOS image to work. BIOS image? The device we are talking about is the original bot system. This means that in order to use the AetherSX2 you will need to remove the BIOS from your PlayStation 2 in order for it to load on your phone. There are many tutorials on this on the internet, but it clearly limits its use for many users. What else do you need to use this emulator? We'll let you know.First of all, it's important to know that you need a powerful smartphone to run PS2 titles on the AetherSX2 emulator. The developer recommends a Snapdragon 845 processor or a comparable or higher processor. These are the four powerful Cortex-A75 Corolla models.",
